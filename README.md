   - Remove files and folders that do not match specified patterns to maintain a clutter-free workspace.

### 2. **CSV-Based Cloning**
   - Clone multiple repositories specified in a CSV file, supporting both default and custom file patterns.

### 3. **Post-Cloning Hooks**
   - Execute custom shell commands after cloning repositories, allowing for automated setup or configuration tasks.

### 4. **Multi-Threaded Cloning**
   - Utilize concurrent threads for cloning multiple repositories, significantly improving performance and reducing wait times.

### 5. **Interactive CLI**
   - User-friendly command-line interface that guides users through cleanup and cloning operations.

### 6. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Comprehensive error logging with detailed context, ensuring a smoother user experience and easier debugging.

### 7. **Summary Report**
   - Generate a summary report detailing operations performed, including total repositories cloned and any errors encountered.

### 8. **Environment Configuration**
   - Load and customize settings from a JSON configuration file, enabling quick adjustments to module behavior.

### 9. **Dry Run Mode**
   - Safely simulate operations without making any actual changes, allowing users to preview the effects of their commands.

### 10. **Custom Patterns**
   - Specify unique file patterns directly in the CSV file for granular control over what files to keep after cloning.

### 11. **Cleanup Options**
   - Choose specific types of files to clean, such as logs and temporary files, ensuring that your working directory remains organized.

### 12. **Enhanced Logging Levels**
   - Control the verbosity of logging output with adjustable logging levels, making it easier to focus on critical information.

### 13. **Summary Report**
   - Automatically generate a comprehensive summary of operations, providing insight into what was cloned, deleted, and any issues that occurred.

## üì¶ Requirements

- **Python 3.6 or higher**
- **Git** must be installed and available in your system's PATH

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone this repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/git-repo-manager.git
   cd git-repo-manager
   ```

2. **(Optional) Create a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The module uses a JSON configuration file (`config.json`) to load default settings. Here‚Äôs a sample configuration:

```json
{
    "default_csv_file": "repositories.csv",
    "clean_directory": ".",
    "default_patterns": ["*.txt", "*.log", "*~"],
    "log_level": "info",
    "max_workers": 4
}
```

You can customize the settings to suit your needs. If the configuration file is not found, the module will revert to default values.

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

To run the Git Repository Manager, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python git_repo_manager.py
```

You will be presented with an interactive menu to choose from the following options:

1. **Clean Files and Folders**
2. **Clone Repositories from CSV**
3. **Generate Summary Report**
4. **Exit**

### Example CSV Format

The CSV file for cloning repositories should have the following format:

```csv
repo_url|target_directory|is_active|depth|custom_patterns
https://github.com/user/repo.git|./repo|true|1|*.py,*.txt
```

- `repo_url`: The URL of the Git repository.
- `target_directory`: The directory where the repository will be cloned.
- `is_active`: Whether the repository should be cloned (`true`/`false`).
- `depth`: The depth of the clone operation.
- `custom_patterns`: Patterns for files to keep after cloning.

## üìú Logging

The module logs operations and errors to `git_repo_manager.log`. Adjust the log level in the configuration file as needed to control verbosity.
